Homework: Weather Intelligence — Unstructured Data → Lakebase Vector Search → REST API
Overview
In the databricks-lakebase-app-day-2 reference app, we synced structured records and news articles from the Massive API into Lakebase, chunked/embedded the news text with sentence-transformers, and stored the vectors in pgvector columns for retrieval-augmented generation.

For this homework, you'll build the same pipeline end-to-end, but for a new unstructured data source: weather. You will:

Harvest unstructured weather text from a public API.

Vectorize that text and load it into Lakebase (Postgres + pgvector).

Add a retrieval endpoint to the Flask REST API that performs semantic search over the ingested weather documents.

By the end, a user should be able to POST /weather/search {"query": "flash flood risk this weekend"} and get back the most semantically relevant weather documents, ranked by vector similarity.

Learning Objectives
Harvest unstructured (free-text) data from a real-world API and normalize it into a document schema.

Design a Postgres/pgvector schema for storing raw documents + embeddings (mirroring the ticker_news_documents / ticker_news_embeddings pattern).

Chunk long text and embed it, matching the project's existing embedding dimensionality conventions.

Write a Python batch job that writes vectors into Lakebase via psycopg2.

Implement a cosine-similarity retrieval endpoint in Flask using pgvector's <=> operator.

Recommended Data Source: National Weather Service API (api.weather.gov)
We recommend the NWS API because:

It's free, requires no API key, and has generous rate limits.

It returns rich unstructured narrative text — perfect for embedding:

GET /alerts/active?area={state} → active weather alerts, each with a free-text description and instruction field (e.g., "A Flash Flood Warning means...").

GET /gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}/forecast → multi-day forecast with a narrative detailedForecast string per period (e.g., "Sunny, with a high near 78. Northwest wind around 6 mph.").

GET /gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}/forecast/hourly → hourly narrative forecasts.

No API key means you can focus on the harvesting/vectorization/retrieval logic instead of auth plumbing.

Alternative sources (if you want a different flavor of unstructured text): OpenWeatherMap's weather + alerts fields, or NOAA's Climate Prediction Center discussion text products (https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov). Pick one and justify your choice in your README — don't mix sources unless you want extra credit for a multi-source pipeline.

Part 1 — Harvest (Ingestion)
Build a client module (mirror massive_client.py), e.g. weather_client.py, that:

Given a list of locations (city/state, or lat/lon pairs), resolves each to a NWS grid point via GET /points/{lat},{lon}.

Fetches active alerts and forecast discussions for each location.

Normalizes each item into a document record with at least:

id (stable dedup key — e.g. alert id field, or location + issued_at hash for forecasts)

location (city/state or lat/lon)

source_type ("alert" or "forecast")

headline / event (e.g. "Flash Flood Warning")

narrative_text (the free-text body to embed — description, instruction, or detailedForecast)

issued_at / effective_at timestamp

payload (raw JSON, for provenance)

synced_at

Write these into a new Lakebase table, e.g. weather_documents, following the same connection pattern as lakebase.py (get_connection() context manager, psycopg2 + RealDictCursor).

Add a Flask endpoint to trigger this:

POST /weather/sync
Body: {"locations": ["Chicago, IL", "Austin, TX"], "limit": 50}
This should behave like /news/sync — fetch, normalize, and upsert into weather_documents, returning a count of documents synced.

Part 2 — Vectorize (Embedding Pipeline)
Build a Python ingestion script (mirror notebooks/ingest_ticker_news_embeddings.py, but written as a plain Python script/notebook using psycopg2 — do not use spark.write.jdbc, which does not work reliably against Lakebase in this environment) that:

Reads unembedded rows from weather_documents via psycopg2 (using the same get_connection() helper as lakebase.py).

Chunks narrative_text for any documents longer than your chosen chunk size (reuse the sliding-window pattern: CHUNK_SIZE=800, CHUNK_OVERLAP=100, or justify your own values — most NWS text is short enough that chunking may only matter for combined alert+instruction text).

Embeds each chunk using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim) — use the same model as the existing news pipeline so both stay compatible/queryable with the same distance operator conventions. (If you pick a different model, document the dimensionality and update the schema accordingly.)

Writes embeddings into a new table, e.g. weather_embeddings:

id, document_id (FK to weather_documents.id), chunk_index, chunk_text, embedding vector(384), model_name, created_at
Writes via psycopg2 — use execute_values (from psycopg2.extras) or batched INSERT ... ON CONFLICT statements for reasonable throughput. Cast the embedding to %s::vector in your SQL (pass the embedding as a Python list/stringified array — psycopg2 + pgvector's adapter will handle the cast) rather than relying on Spark's JDBC stringtype=unspecified trick, since Spark JDBC writes are not supported against this Lakebase instance.

If you need distributed/parallel processing for large batches, use plain Python (e.g. concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) or simply batch your psycopg2 inserts — do not reach for Spark for the write path.

You must create the weather_embeddings table with a proper vector(384) column (requires the pgvector extension, already enabled in this Lakebase instance) and an appropriate index (e.g. CREATE INDEX ... USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) or ivfflat) for retrieval performance.

Part 3 — Retrieve (REST API)
Add a new endpoint to app.py:

POST /weather/search
Body: {"query": "risk of flooding near rivers", "top_k": 5}
This endpoint should:

Embed the query string using the same model used for ingestion (load it once at module/app level, not per-request).

Run a cosine-similarity search against weather_embeddings using pgvector's <=> operator, executed via psycopg2:

SELECT d.id, d.location, d.headline, d.narrative_text, e.chunk_text,
       1 - (e.embedding  %s::vector) AS similarity
FROM weather_embeddings e
JOIN weather_documents d ON d.id = e.document_id
ORDER BY e.embedding  %s::vector
LIMIT %s;
Return the top top_k matches as JSON, each with location, headline, chunk_text, and similarity score.
Edge cases to handle: empty weather_embeddings table (no data synced yet), malformed/missing query, top_k bounds (clamp to e.g. 1–20).

Deliverables
weather_client.py — NWS API client (or your chosen source).

Updated app.py with POST /weather/sync and POST /weather/search.

Updated lakebase.py (or a new module) with DDL/migration for weather_documents and weather_embeddings.

A psycopg2-based embedding ingestion script (notebooks/ingest_weather_embeddings.py or equivalent scripts).

A short README_WEATHER.md (or a section in the main README) explaining:

Which data source you chose and why.

Your schema decisions (columns, chunking parameters, embedding model/dimensions).

How to run the sync → embed → search pipeline end-to-end.

Any known limitations or things you'd improve given more time.

Stretch Goals (optional, for extra credit)
Add a GET /weather/search?query=... variant that also returns an LLM-generated natural-language summary of the top results (basic RAG).

Deduplicate/upsert on id so re-running /weather/sync doesn't create duplicate rows.

Add a scheduled Databricks Job (or simple cron) that re-syncs alerts every N minutes.

Combine two data sources (e.g. alerts + forecast discussions) and let retrieval filter by source_type.

Add a CREATE INDEX ... USING hnsw benchmark comparing query latency with vs. without the index.
